## Frontend
- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the webpage and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **styles.css**: Contains styles for the frontend application, defining the visual presentation of HTML elements.
- **main.js**: Handles interactivity and dynamic behavior of the webpage.

## Backend
- **main.py**: The main entry point for the backend application, containing server setup and route definitions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the backend application.
- **Dockerfile**: (Optional) Contains instructions for building a Docker image for the backend application.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application.
3. For the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required dependencies using:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the backend server using:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Access the frontend application through your web browser.
- The backend will handle requests as defined in `main.py`.
